     \tau = \frac{L}{R}
     \]
     Where \(L\) is inductance, and \(R\) is resistance.
   - **Transient Current Equation**:
     \[
     I(t) = I_{\text{final}}(1 - e^{-t/\tau})
     \]

2. **RC Circuits (Resistor-Capacitor)**:
   - When a voltage source is applied:
     - Voltage across the capacitor increases gradually.
     - Current decreases exponentially as the capacitor charges.
   - **Time Constant (\(\tau\))**:
     \[
     \tau = RC
     \]
     Where \(R\) is resistance, and \(C\) is capacitance.
   - **Voltage Across the Capacitor**:
     \[
     V_C(t) = V_{\text{final}}(1 - e^{-t/\tau})
     \]
   - **Current in the Circuit**:
     \[
     I(t) = I_0 e^{-t/\tau}
     \]
